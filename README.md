## INTRODUCTION
It is important for any manufacturing company, to ensure efficient production performance in order to fulfill client demands, optimize resources, and maximize profits. This created the need for this analysis as it will offer significant insights into production performance across multiple dimensions

The Manufacturing Performance report can be used by the management team of the company to monitor and evaluate key production indicators, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven choices to optimize operations. 


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To provide insights into production performance by various categories and time periods.

## Skills and Concepts demonstrated:
 
 - SQL (Select, alias, Views)
 - PowerBI concepts like:
   - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations using DAX Suggestion(CO-PILOT),
   - Data Modelling,
   - Measures,
   - filters,
   - tooltips, 
   - Page buttons,
   - Data Visualization
  
## Data Source:

The data used for this work is obtained from AdventureWorks2019 database tables - Production.Product, Production.BillOfMaterials, Production.WorkOrder, and  Production.WorkOrderRouting.
  - You can find a link to get started with installation and restoration of the database to your local machine.  [here:](https://youtu.be/VpY0Q_kwtIw)
